echo Hello, and welcome to my house.
echo In this script you will walk around my residence, and maybe through a little bit of magic, feel like we were there together through spacetime - close in spirit, if far in proximity.
echo There may be some hidden options from time to time, paths will obviously be expanded as I continue working on this
echo.
echo Please enjoy! And if you encounter bugs or have suggestions, reach out to me. Yall know where I live after all~~
echo     -- Love, Elfy
